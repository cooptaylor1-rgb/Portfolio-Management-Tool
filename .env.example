# Portfolio Management Tool - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials
# NEVER commit the .env file to version control!

# Backend API origin (NOT including /api/v2)
# Examples:
#   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
#   VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: override WebSocket URL for real-time market stream
# Defaults to derived from VITE_API_URL: ws(s)://<host>/api/v2/market/stream
# Example:
#   VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000/api/v2/market/stream
#   VITE_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com/api/v2/market/stream

# Provider API keys (FactSet / AlphaVantage / OpenAI) must be configured server-side.
# See backend/.env.example for:
#   FACTSET_USERNAME, FACTSET_API_KEY, ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY

# Note: In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# to be exposed to the client-side code
# The .env file is already protected by .gitignore
